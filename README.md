Using Random Forest Regressor and Linear Regression in Machine Learning for predicting Crude Oil prices using different attributes for training, testing and splitting data and evaluating the model by RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), R2_Score (R-Squared), Real-time data and Regression which is giving the results of RMSE=𝟎.𝟖𝟑𝟒𝟓𝟔𝟕𝟕𝟕𝟕𝟓𝟖𝟗 and R2_Score=𝟎.𝟗𝟗𝟖𝟕𝟓𝟒𝟑𝟏𝟐𝟓𝟔 and therefore, making the model top for price prediction of crude oil in future and thus, adding business value.
